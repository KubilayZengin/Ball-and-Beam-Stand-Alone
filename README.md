Python 3.7.4

Author: Kubilay ZENGÄ°N

This source code is designed for Ball and Beam system by Acrome Robotics. 

Both files with PyQt and Customtkinter are available.

"images" file must be in the same folder with main.py and main_qt.py

PID.py file is not correct for now, it needs to be done according to the real Ball and Beam system.
