Python 3.7.4

Author: Kubilay ZENGÄ°N

This source code is designed for Ball and Beam system by Acrome Robotics. 

Both files with PyQt and Customtkinter are available.

"images" file must be in the same folder with main.py and main_qt.py

For the GUI to work properly, the Arduino code in the Github must be uploaded to the currently used arduino.

PID.py file is not correct for now, it needs to be done according to the real Ball and Beam system.
